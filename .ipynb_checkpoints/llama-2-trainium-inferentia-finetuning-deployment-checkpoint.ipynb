    "To deploy a model on [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) or [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/) based instances, we will firstly need call PyTorch Neuron ([torch-neuronx](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/arch/neuron-features/neuron-caching.html?highlight=graph#neuron-persistent-cache)) to compile the model into a Neuron specific graph. Then during runtime the graph is executed on the **NeuronCores** of the [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) or [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/) based instances. Compiling the graph involves running optimizations that can make use of the NeuronCores efficiently.\n",

Otherwise, the compilation will be triggered during endpoint deployment, which will take a slightly longer time to deploy a model.\n",

Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",

    "- max_input_length: Maximum total input sequence length after tokenization. Sequences longer than this will be truncated. Default: 2048.\n",
    "- learning_rate: The rate at which the model weights are updated after working through each batch of training examples. Must be a positive float greater than 0. Default: 6e-6.\n",
    "- min_learning_rate: The learning rate at the last step of learning rate scheduler 'CosineAnnealing'. Default: 1e-06.\n",
    "- global_train_batch_size: The global batch size for training. Based on global_train_batch_size, the gradient accumulation is calculated as global_train_batch_size / (data_parallel_degree * per_device_train_batch_size), where data_parallel_degree is calculated as total number of neuron cores / (tensor_parallel_degree * pipeline_parallel_degree). Default: 256.\n",
    "- per_device_train_batch_size: The batch size per Neuron core for training. Default: 1\n",
    "- layer_norm_epilson: During layer normalization, a value added to the denominator for numerical stability. See [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LayerNorm.html). Default: 0.00001.\n",
    "- preprocessing_num_workers: The number of processors to use for the preprocessing. If None, all of workers (number of vCPUs) are used for preprocessing. Default: \"None\"\n",
    "- weight_decay: The weight decay to apply (if not zero) to all layers except all bias and LayerNorm weights in `AdamW` optimizer. Default: 0.1.\n",
    "- lr_scheduler_type: Learning rate scheduler type. Default: 'CosineAnnealing' (currently we only support 'CosineAnnealing' scheduler type).\n",
    "- warmup_steps: Linear warmup over warmup steps. Default: 10.\n",
    "- constant_steps: The number of steps for learning rate to be constant after warmup_steps in 'CosineAnnealing' scheduler type. Default: 0.\n",
    "- adam_beta1: The beta1 hyperparameter (exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates) for the AdamW optimizer. Default: 0.9.\n",
    "- adam_beta2: The beta2 hyperparameter (exponential decay rate for the first moment estimates) for the AdamW optimizer. Default: 0.95.\n",
    "- mixed_precision: Whether to use mixed precision. If mixed_precision to be 'True', it means that master weights and optimizer states are stored in fp32, and model weights are saved in bf16. For details, see [reference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03740.pdf). Default: 'True'.\n",
    "- tensor_parallel_degree: The number of neuron cores which specific model weights, gradients, and optimizer states are split across. For details, see [reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-tensor-parallelism.html). Default: \"8\" (currently we only support parallel degree as 8).\n",
