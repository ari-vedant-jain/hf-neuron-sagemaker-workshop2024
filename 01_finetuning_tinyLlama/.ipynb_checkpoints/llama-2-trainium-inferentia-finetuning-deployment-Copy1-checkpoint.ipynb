    "To deploy a model on [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) or [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/) based instances, we will firstly need call PyTorch Neuron ([torch-neuronx](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/arch/neuron-features/neuron-caching.html?highlight=graph#neuron-persistent-cache)) to compile the model into a Neuron specific graph. Then during runtime the graph is executed on the **NeuronCores** of the [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/) or [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/) based instances. Compiling the graph involves running optimizations that can make use of the NeuronCores efficiently.\n",

Otherwise, the compilation will be triggered during endpoint deployment, which will take a slightly longer time to deploy a model.\n",
